# ExpertPriceCrawler

## Console App
### Requirements
- Before you download the Console App, make sure you have [DotNet 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed.

### Download and usage
- Go to [release section](https://github.com/awinnen/ExpertPriceCrawler/releases) of this repository and download latest version as zip (e.g. ExpertPriceCrawler-0.5.zip)
- Extract the zip archive to any directory on your computer
- Open the directory to which you extracted the archive with explorer
- Find _ExpertPriceCrawler.Shell.exe_ and double-click it
  - When Windows warns you that the file _might_ hurt your computer, you must proceed the execution. If you don't trust the Application, you can't use it. Sorry :)
  - A Console Window will open. It asks you for expert product url
- On first usage, the App will download a chromium browser. Therefore the first crawling might take a feq minutes. Just be patient and wait until you see many messages in the Console window.
